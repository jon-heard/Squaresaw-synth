fixup and consolidate ui system
dragging to sequencer panel doesn't work right (tends to drag to instrument panel)
see to it that keyboard keeps track of previous presses (up to 5) and switches back when further presses are released
Transfer audio buffer building to C functions
Have confirmation for:
	overwriting preset
	overwriting a category (more of a notification that it already exists, really)

find way to setup timing to be independent of buffer fill threads
fix arpegiation clicking

get bender mode working (?) (pitch bend)
	alternate mode in keyboard... keyboard sends back frequency changes during drag
	instrument must be able to take frequency changes along with notes

confirm dialog (ok/close).  Used:
	when loading song over dirty song
	when deleting song
	when quitting w/ dirty song

Figure out how to stop ending pop on notes
fix buzzing in waves
figure out how to get re-sizable in windows
make keyboard resizable (dragging)
fine tune the knobs
optimize w/ profiler
